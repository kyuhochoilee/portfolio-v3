# About the Project

Paradigm is a startup founded by Penn alum revolutionizing the spreadsheet using AI agents. I redesigned the entire interface to breathe—widening the sidebar, freshening the buttons, and introducing a full-fledged Workspace file manager with Starred, Shared with Me, and Files. A streamlined Recents preview, collapsible Home sections, color-coded folders, editable sheet icons, and a quick grid/list toggle make organizing and navigating dramatically faster while keeping the UI clean. Below are a few key screens; to explore the full case study, view the complete project here → [link](https://www.figma.com/design/etcKzyxy73ATdMTWZI7TRI/Kyuho-Lee-%E2%80%94-Paradigm-Redesign?node-id=0-1&t=C2zoLFkbUfarFl0d-1)
