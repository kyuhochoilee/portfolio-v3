# About Speak

I joined Speak—the AI-powered language-learning app backed by OpenAI, Khosla Ventures, and Buckley Ventures—as the company’s only designer at the time. Starting from a blank canvas, I built a cross-platform design system and integrated it into both engineering and product workflows. As the team grew from one to five designers, I defined, documented, and ran the design-ops process that underpinned every new feature. Along the way I shipped major UI pillars—including a full home-screen revamp, a re-imagined course view, an end-of-lesson experience, and new paywalls. After the summer, I continued as a part-time contractor, shifting towards a Design Engineering role where I built and shipped features using SwiftUI.

# Home-Screen Redesign

As the daily landing place for hundreds of thousands of learners, the home screen needed to feel inviting yet purposeful. I led a complete overhaul that introduced a spacious card layout, contextual progress indicators, and a clearer visual hierarchy. The project served as the first real-world test of the new design system, while I carried out the formalized Design-to-Engineering handoff.

# Course View Revamp

Building on the new home experience, I re-imagined the course view so it could be reached with a single swipe. A deck-style carousel now previews upcoming lessons and animates open to reveal “Today you’ll learn …” teasers. Motion guides users without slowing them, and a reorganized information architecture ensures any course, unit, or lesson is no more than three taps away.

# Unit Summaries in SwiftUI

Transitioning into a part-time Design Engineer role during my senior year, I shipped the Unit Summary feature — my first production work in SwiftUI. I built out the entire front-end, and connected it to the backend. Within a month, the feature was shipped!

# Reflections

These launches deepened my understanding of the friction points between design and engineering and showed how a living design system, paired with clear ops, keeps teams aligned. They also taught me how to contribute front-end code to a large production repo and how carefully timed motion can guide learners while celebrating their progress.
