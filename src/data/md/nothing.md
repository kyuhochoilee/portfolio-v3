# About the Project

This album represents the most complete expression of my artistic work so far. As part of my senior thesis at the University of Pennsylvania, I challenged myself to finish a full album—not just the songs, but the entire visual and design experience that surrounds it. The process was both demanding and rewarding, and pushed me to grow in ways I didn’t expect.
