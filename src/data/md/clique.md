# About the Project

Clique is a social media app that I am currently working on with two other co-founders. Gone are the days of searching for that one picture from that one night — with Clique, you can organize and share your photos, by people, by moment.

# Overview

Below are a few key screens and interactions of the app. It's a bit difficult to completely document everything that I've done, since it's just everything! Everything that you see, from the branding to the product, has been designed by me. I've also worked on a good amount of the front-end, as I am the only design-oriented individual on the team. We're currently on TestFlight, but we hope to launch Fall 2025.
