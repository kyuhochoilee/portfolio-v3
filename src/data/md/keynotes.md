# Project Overview

Every semester, my college a cappella group holds a concert. For each of the 8 concerts I performed in, I led the creative direction of our promotional material. It became a semesterly challenge to develop a distinct brand and show experience, and a great way to grow my creative abilities every semester.

# Work Samples

For each show, there needed to be a theme, a name, a photoshoot, graphic design guidelines, and a printed program. Below are some of my favorites from over the years — and feel free to visit the website I created, [pennkeynotes.com/media](https://pennkeynotes.com/media), for even more work samples!
